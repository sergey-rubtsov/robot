# NESTang - FPGA NES with Sipeed Tang 25K Boards


NESTang is an open source project to recreate the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) with modern affordable FPGA boards. The main logic comes from [fpganes](https://github.com/strigeus/fpganes).

Main features,

- HDMI output with a resolution of 720p and sound capabilities.
